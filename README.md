# Kanaraimasu (Kana 習います)

Learn to draw Japanese kana!

## How to use

### Download python

Download and install Python3 (version 3.7.7 or higher).
You can download python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

### Install dependencies

Kanaraimasu depends on pygame, this can be installed by opening a command prompt / terminal and running the following command:

#### Windows

```cmd
python.exe -m pip install pygame
```

If windows complains about "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases." you can try using `py` instead of `python.exe`:

```cmd
py -m pip install pygame
```

Or you can try again after removing the shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases, as mentioned in the message.

#### Linux

```bash
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

### Run the application

Either click on `kanaraimasu.py` and run it with python.

Or launch it from the console (command prompt / terminal), making sure that the console is opened in the same directory as `kanaraimasu.py` resides, by running:

#### Windows

```cmd
python.exe kanaraimasu.py
```

Or when `python.exe` is not working like in the previous step, use `py` instead of `python.exe`:

```cmd
py kanaraimasu.py
```

#### Linux

```bash
python3 kanaraimasu.py
```
